# Local additions to the cdbsvcd generated Apache httpd.conf file
#
# Configurations that are only valid before vhost environment
# This is included right after most modules have been loaded.

# THIS IS NOT A PYTHON FILE!
#
# This file may be used for your own additions to the Apache configuration.
#
# Most of the basic configuration is done by an auto-generated configuration
# file from the cdbsvcd service.
#
# The typical cdb environment variables are available for setting
# up pathes, etc., this includes:
# ${CADDOK_BASE}, ${CADDOK_HOME}, ${CADDOK_RUNTIME}
#
# You may not use Python syntax in this file, e.g.
# setting CADDOK_DEBUG=xyz will have no effect at all or raise syntax errors.
#
# Have a look at the documentation for httpd.conf for details.
# https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/configuring.html
#


# Some settings are only valid or useful early in the configuration, before
# virtual hosts are defined. You can set those settings in this file.
