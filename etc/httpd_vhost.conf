# Local additions to the cdbsvcd generated Apache httpd.conf file
#
# Configurations that are only valid in the vhost environment
# can be placed in this file.

#
# THIS IS NOT A PYTHON FILE!
#
# This file may be used for your own additions to the Apache configuration.
#
# Most of the basic configuration is done by an auto-generated configuration
# file from the cdbsvcd service.
#
# The typical cdb environment variables are available for setting
# up pathes, etc., this includes:
# ${CADDOK_BASE}, ${CADDOK_HOME}, ${CADDOK_RUNTIME}
#
# You may not use Python syntax in this file, e.g.
# setting CADDOK_DEBUG=xyz will have no effect at all or raise syntax errors.
#
# Have a look at the documentation for httpd.conf for details.
# https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/configuring.html
#


# Some settings are only valid or useful inside a vhost environment, not outside,
# so they cannot be put in the generic httpd.conf file.
# This file gets inserted at the end of the <virtualhost> part of the main configuration,
# so you can add extra things to the vhost definition.

# Limit / Extend Allowed Request Header Length
#
# Sometimes you need extra long header lines, e.g. for SPNEGO tokens of a user
# who is member of a few hundred groups, and the default 8k size is too small.
# 
# See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/327825 for a description of the problem.
# This uses the LimitRequestFieldSize Directive to increase the default
