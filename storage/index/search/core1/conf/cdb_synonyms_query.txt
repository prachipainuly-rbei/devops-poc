# Define synonyms to use when querying.
# 
# Use cdb_synonyms_index.txt to define synonyms to use 
# when indexing.
#
# Caution: Synonyms must *not* be defined in both files,
#          cdb_synonyms_index.txt and cdb_synonyms_query.txt!
#
# Format:
# =======
#
# 1. Explicit mapping. Replace all (comma separated) words at the
#    left side of "=>" by all words at the right side of the token.
#    Example:
#       i-pod, i pod => ipod
#
# 2. Synonym lists. Will be triggered if any word from the list
#    is found. The effect depends of the "expand" flag of the
#    SynonymFilterFactory defined in the schema.
#    The entry:
#       ipod, i-pod, i pod
#    will produce the tokens 
#       "ipod", "i-pod" and "i pod"
#    if expand is true, but only 
#       "ipod" 
#    (the first word) if expand is set to false.
