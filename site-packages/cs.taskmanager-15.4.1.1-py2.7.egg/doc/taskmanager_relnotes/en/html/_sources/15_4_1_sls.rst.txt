=======================

Support Multiselect
-------------------

This Service Level enables selecting multiple table rows in order to run operations from the table
header on all of the selected objects in one go.

.. note ::
    This only works with operations configured for `MultipleObjects` and selections consisting of
    a single object type. In particular, the operation `CDB_Workflow` (Status Change) does not
    work for more than a single object.
