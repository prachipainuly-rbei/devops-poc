Service Levels
##############

cs.taskmanager 15.4.0.11
========================

Standard SplitterLayout Component
---------------------------------

Starting with this service level, |cs.taskmanager| uses the standard
"SplitterLayout" component from cs.web.

This component behaves a little different than before. While the old component
did not allow resizing that would result in panes being smaller than some
configured minimum sizes, the new component will collapse the pane instead.

Also, the new component does not yet persist user-specific sizes across
sessions. This feature will be shipped in cs.web shortly.

cs.taskmanager 15.4.0.6
=======================

Typeahead Support for User Tags
-------------------------------

This changes the database schema of ``cs_tasks_tag``:

    - Long text relation ``cs_tasks_tag_txt`` removed
    - Primary key attribute ``cs_tasks_tag.tag`` added

The included update script prepares the schema change.

Save default table settings as user settings
--------------------------------------------

Because of easier handling, default application and table settings for
|cs.taskmanager| are now stored as user settings for new dummy user
`cs.taskmanager.dflt`.

Existing settings will be migrated automatically.

.. warning::
    Because of this change, |con15.2| SL 18 or newer is required.

Removed Unused "Calculated" Priority
------------------------------------

Removed unused column ``cs_tasks_col_calculated_prio`` along with all settings
and cell plugins. If you have been using this column, please copy the relevant
code and configuration from ``cs.taskmanager 15.3.0`` into your custom module.
