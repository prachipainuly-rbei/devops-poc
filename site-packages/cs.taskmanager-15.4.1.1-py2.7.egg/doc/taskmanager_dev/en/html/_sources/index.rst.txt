cs.taskmanager Developer Manual
================================================================================

*cs.taskmanager* is a personal to do web application allowing users to:

- See their current tasks at a glance
- Group, sort, and filter them
- Select a task to see its context and most important information
- Access task operations quickly

It is implemented using the *cs.web* technology stack, predominantly:

- **Backend**: Powerscript and morepath
- **Frontend**: React and Redux

The main application is ``cs-taskmanager-web`` and is mounted at ``/tasks``. A
task's ``cdb_object_id`` may be appended to the URL to preselect it.
