    WHEN user opens the Task Manager
        AND user hides the column 'Typ'
    THEN the tasks table is displayed
        AND the column 'Typ' is hidden


Scenario: Save and Re-Use Table Settings
    GIVEN a task class exists
    WHEN user opens the Task Manager
        AND user hides the column 'Typ'
        AND user saves the settings as 'TEST SETTINGS'
        AND user re-opens the Task Manager
    THEN the tasks table is displayed
        AND the column 'Typ' is hidden
