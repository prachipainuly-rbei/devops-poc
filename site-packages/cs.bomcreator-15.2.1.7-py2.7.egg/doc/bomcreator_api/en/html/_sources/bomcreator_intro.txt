Powerscript API
===============

PowerScript is the development environment of the system,
which enables you to develop add ons, user exits, stand alone scripts or
complex applications based on or integrated with the  |cs.platform|. This document
only describes the APIs that are important for the ``bomcreator`` package. A
powerscript manual is part of the |cs.platform| documenation.
