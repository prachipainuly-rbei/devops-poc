Stuff that has to be tested manually:
- quick interactive check of basic functionality (toplevel code not in unit test)
- application of object rules (all three)
  also: deleted/renamed object rules

- situation: no valid configuration for current user + document
  expected: hint in GUI + usage of hard-coded defaults

- wrong configuration:
   - empty Tabellenspalten
     expected: log message + use default
   - empty Schlüsselattribute
   - empty name of appinfo attribute

- Recursive Reader:
   - referenced document not found
