Using Icons in Development
##########################

Following these guidelines ensures correct selection and use of icon assets in development.


.. _`icon_naming`:

Naming Convention
=================

The naming scheme for icon source files is `cis_<icon-name>_<semantic-color>.svg`.
Prefix and suffix are delimited with an `_` underscore.

1. `cis` prefix for contact icon system.

2. `<icon-name>` describes the semantic of the glyph. A `-` hyphen is used as a spacer if necessary.

3. `<semantic-color>` suffix for the semantic color category.

Example: `cis_circle-arrow-right_info.svg`

It is strongly advised to keep the naming scheme and not rename icon source files so that they can be identified and thus better maintained.
If for some reason it is absolutely necessary to rename the source file in the destination,
the svg code features two tags that identify icon name and semantic independently of file system name.
Do not edit these or any other part of the icon's svg source code.

.. _`icon_coloring`:

Color Palette
=============

For every icon in the set, the design system package contains a svg source file for every color in the icon color palette.
If in doubt which color to pick, use the default color as given in the :ref:`design_system_icons_assets`.

The icon color palette is a minimized version of the global color palette. It consists of six entities: primary, success, info, warning, danger and gray.
This section gives advice on choosing the right color for an icon glyph.

Similar to using color in other UI elements, the semantic colors (success, info, warning and danger) should only be used to draw usersâ€™ attention, therefore they should be used carefully and sparingly. The use of semantic color should serve the purpose of better data visualization and clearer information architecture.

Coloring Icons
==============

Intepretation of color can be very personal and is usually not black or white. The following step-to-step process helps objectify icon colors.

**Step 1** Firstly, the color of an icon is decided by its context of usage.

That said, the navigation icons are firstly in primary blue, afterwards changed to corresponding product colors by the branding package. The utility icons are in gray.

For object, operation and toggle icons go to step 2.

**Step 2** In cases of object, operation and toggle icons, different rules per category applies.

- For an object icon, if it is generic and unique, color it in primary blue. If not, follow the general rule of thumb.

- For an operation icon, follow the general rule of thumb. If the general rule of thumb is not sufficient or the icon needs to be more specific (usually designed with a modifier), follow the conditional rule of thumb.

- For a toggle icon, if it is massively used and widely established pattern, color it in gray. If not, follow the general rule of thumb. If the general rule of thumb is not sufficient or the icon needs to be more specific (usually designed with a modifier), follow the conditional rule of thumb.

General Rule of Thumb
---------------------

The general rule of thumb is defined by the icon's relation with data.

- Primary: I as user navigate through the interface without data modification. E.g. change view, filter, sort by, zoom.
- Success: I as user change or add something. E.g. add, modify, status change, start, finish, share, import, upload.
- Info: I as user retrieve information from the system. E.g. sorting, helper, notification, more, open, sync, export, download, show, hide.
- Warning: I as user modify sensitive data. E.g. unsubscribe, deny.
- Danger: I as user modify sensitive data and the modification is irreversible. E.g. reset, delete, remove.

Conditional Rule of Thumb
-------------------------

The conditional rule of thumb is defined by the status or severity level of the icon.

- Positive: success. E.g. available resource/user.
- Neutral: info. E.g. checklist 3/4.
- Negative: warning. E.g. checklist 5/6.
- Critical: danger. E.g. denied signature.
- Disabled: gray. E.g. outdated requirement.

Cultural Rules
--------------

Besides coloring icons according to its semantics, the cultural rules can also be useful. Inspiration from the real world can be concluded as the "roses are red, violets are blue" rule.

.. The essential icons from Platform, Web, Virtual Product and Project Office are the best practices regarding coloring. They are reviewed by our peers and should be consistently used in the applications. You can also refer to them when coloring a new icon.

   Revisit SSoT in SL1, vet the icons with guidelines and update the screenshot.

.. caution:: In summary, the process of coloring icons is not simple. The consistent use of icons in the product, rather than personal interpretation of icon colors, is key to better recognizability and efficiency. Use the original icons from the icon library to keep the consistency in the product.


.. _`icon_sizing`:

Sizes
=====

The perceived size of an icon to human eye is the safe area (12x12px).
In order to keep the alignment of the glyph and the bleeded content in the icon file,
the actual svg icon file has a size of 16px by 16px.
These are the dimensions of the base icon size `sm`, the sizes `md` and `lg` are multiples of this.

Icons can be easily scaled using the :ref:`design_system_components_icon` components.
