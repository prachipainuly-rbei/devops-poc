We use Bootstrap and React JS as our framework, on which the component library is based on but not limited to. The component library aims to build a fully comprehensive library of reusable components. However, it can’t provide everything.
It is more than appreciated to build up new components following the guidelines and styles. By doing this, we are following Postel’s Law, meaning “being liberal in accepting things into the system, and being liberal about how you go about that, ensures you don’t police the system. You collaborate on it.”
