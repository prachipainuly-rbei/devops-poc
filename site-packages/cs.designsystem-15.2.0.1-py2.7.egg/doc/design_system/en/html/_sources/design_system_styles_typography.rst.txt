Typography
==========

Typography is a powerful design element for creating structure and building contrast in the interface and communicating the design values in a subtle manner.

The typeface used in Elements UI is Source Sans Pro, which is also the corporate type from CONTACT Software.

Derived from this typeface, various fonts are created for headings and paragraphs.

.. note:: 
    Only apply $font-size-small and $font-size-base for text in paragraphs. Headings in the UI and components should use the corresponding $font-size-h1/2/3/4.

.. note::
   Customized font sizes should use relative units such as rem, em for better responsiveness.
