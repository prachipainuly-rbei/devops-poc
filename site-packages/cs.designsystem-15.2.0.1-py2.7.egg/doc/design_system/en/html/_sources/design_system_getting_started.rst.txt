Getting Started
###############

A quick intro to the design system based on your perspective.

Designers
=========

As a foundation, familiarize yourself with the :ref:`design_system_guidelines_design_principles`.

If you are designing new interaction patterns, get to know the :ref:`design_system_guidelines`.
Also, it is good practice to browse the :ref:`design_system_components` for existing pattern implementations.

For specifics on visual design check out the :ref:`design_system_styles`.

The :ref:`design_system_resources` chapter has details on where to find assets to get you started.


Developers
==========

If you are using existing components for your application, get an overview of available :ref:`design_system_components`.
The catalog contains component renderings, description, and links to the API documentation.

If you are developing components, you should also get familiar with the :ref:`design_system_styles` chapter.
It gives valuable information on how to use color, typography, and icons in your components.

In case you are just looking for an icon source, jump straight to the :ref:`design_system_resources`.
Also make sure to read the instructions on how to use the icon library in the section on :ref:`design_system_styles_iconography`.
