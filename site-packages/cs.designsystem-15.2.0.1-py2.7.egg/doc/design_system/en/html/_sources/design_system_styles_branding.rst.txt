Branding
########

The branding guidelines are the reference point for the branding concept. The initial `Branding Goals`_ of the web interface branding are documented here. The branding concept explains the `Principles and Methods`_.  

The UX team owns the guidelines. In case of ambiguity or feedback, please `contact the UX team <mailto:ux@contact-software.com>`_.

For CONTACT internal use, you can create a `change request in CEDM under cs.designsystem <cdb://byname/classname/cdberror/CDB_Search/batch?.howto=https:%2F%2Fhowto.contact.de%2Fwiki%2FChange_Request&cdbprojekt.projektname=cs.designsystem>`_.


Usage
=====

The branding guidelines assist a consistent branding in the user interfaces for all products in the web. Following the guidelines for branding the product also reinforces the corporate design. 

For CONTACT internal use, it is recommended to acknowledge the `brand manual <cdb://byname/classname/document/CDB_ShowObject/interactive?zeichnung.z_nummer=D088541&zeichnung.z_index=>`_.

The guidelines shall also help the further conception in future releases. For example, when modification of branding elements is needed or even the concept itself needs to be adjusted.

However, the guidelines do not specify the implementation of the concept. You can refer to :ref:`web_ui_branding` documentation regarding the implementation. The guidelines do not contain the detailed specifications and behavior due to the complexity and flexibility of the browser. It will be included in the coming versions.


Target Group
============

Anyone involved in the product development process can profit from the guidelines. 

Product managers can get an overview of the concept and supervise further evolvement of the product branding in the coming releases. 

Software developers can refer to the guidelines for specifications of the implementation accordingly.

Solution engineers can also refer to the guidelines for designing other customer specific solution.

- The UI shows a competitive visual design and tackles an emotional approach.

Principles and Methods
**********************

To achieve the branding goals the product design shall reflect and integrate the corporate design smoothly. Strategically, the essence of the corporate design can be revealed by its design principles. Therefore, the product branding concept applies the same design principles: layer, contrast and building blocks.

Individual methods are also invented regarding each principle:

- Layer: the user interface is divided into three physical layers.

- Contrast: the contrast between each layer is enhanced by colors.

- Building block: the Elements UI components serve as the building blocks on top of the basis layer.

The product branding is not only concluded by the physical frame of the user interface, but also completed by the frame of time user spent using the product.

Base Layer
----------

In the base layer of Workspaces, the color and product logo explicitly brands the user interface.

The navigation bar can be collapsed and remains collapsed.

Content Layer
-------------

.. figure:: images/branding_concept_03.png
   :scale: 45%

In the content layer, the user interface should firstly serve the purpose of helping users accomplish their tasks. Therefore the colors communicate semantic meanings, e.g. red means alert. The Elements UI components here are **not** branded per product. Instead they use the Elements UI color palette.

This is the content layer filled with Element UI components.

Ribbon Layer
------------

In the ribbon layer, the user interface is branded repeatedly in order to enhance the overall product branding.

The ribbon layer can be a modal, the login screen, the about page, error page etc.

Branded Elements
****************

The branded Elements UI (development status for 15.3) is included here as a reference for the branded elements.

The login page is branded and the product logo (without wordmark) is in place of the favicon.

The key visual is selected by the marketing department and the UX team to guarantee a harmonious image for both external and internal usages.

The navigation bar can be minimized by the user and displays only the application icons once minimized.

Modals in Elements UI are also branded accordingly.
