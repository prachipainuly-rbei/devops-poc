Authoring Icon Assets
#####################

The CONTACT Elements Iconset builds on and expands the Glyphicon Halfings Set.
Following these guidelines ensures that new icons are consistent with the established look and feel.


Use Geometric Forms
===================

Icons are constructed with help of basic forms (circles, triangles, rectangles). Avoid using organic forms as those are harder to read and thus could lead to cognitive overload when placed among other more complex icons.


Be as Generic as Possible
=========================

In order to  cover a lot of use cases and scenarios icons should at first be designed as generic as possible. Try to avoid and remove as many details as possible, until nothing can be compromised anymore to identify the semantic of an icon. If the context asks for a more specfic representation of an object/action try to adapt to the generic, abstract base forms.

Icons (Mostly) Live in a Flat World
===================================

The icons live in a 2-dimensional world. That‘s why they stay flat. Icons should only be constructed in 3D, if it is not possible to recognize their semantic otherwise or if the context asks for it. An example: An icon that is used to display a 3D preview can indeed be constructed within a 3D world. For scenarios like these it is allowed to break out of the 2D paradigm.

3D Representations
------------------
If it is not possible to avoid a 3D-representation, imagine the camera to be positioned in the top-right corner or in the top-center area while desigining the glyph. By that we ensure a consistent viewing angle throughout the virtual 3D world.

Filled and Outlined Icons
=========================
Icons are filled most of the time. Outlined icons should only be used in cases of switchable glyphs (like starred or not starred) or if the icon should communicate an empty semantic (like an empty folder).

Outlined icon have a stroke size of 1px for ther main body.

Stroke Sizes
============
The Elements Icon Set familiarizes three stroke sizes. Maintain them for a unified appearance within the icon set.

Small: 1px for outlined objects and thin lines

Medium: 1.5px for curves and outlined circles (needed for pixel crispness)

Large: 2px for normal lines

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_06.png
   :alt: Use one of the three given sizes for strokes


Corners Are Rounded
===================
The icons have rounded corners for a smooth and friendly appearance. They are the key for a unified icon family. Inner shapes (the shape which is the intercounter part of another shape) are not meant to have rounded corners, unless they are „naturally“ created due to negative spacing.

The Icon Set currently maintains two corner radii.

Small: 0.5px  (default corner radius)

Large: 1.0px (for icons that resemble objects that have more rounded shapes in real life such as batteries or speech bubbles)

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_05.png

Negative Space
==============
The icon set uses a minimum of 1px for negative space. Negative space is crucial for separating objects within a glyph, separating elements of an object within a glyph or placing additional modifiers on top of a glyph.

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_08.png
   :alt: Use 1px negative space to separate glyphs within an icon


Layering of Glyphs
==================
There are scenarios where icons have to display multiple glyphs in one icon to communicate the right semantic.


Multiples of Objects
--------------------
If the icon displays multiple objects of the same type to communicate a multiple of the same object, place the first layer at the top right corner and the second layer on the bottom-left corner. If the area is not sufficient or the glyphs shall be positioned on the same hierarchical level, stack them next to each other.

   :alt: Layer glyphs accordingly if only multiples of objects shall be displayed


Action
------
If the specific icon shows an advancing process (e.g. copying) place the first layer at the top-left corner and the second layer at the bottom-righter corner.

Usage of badges
===============
Icons can be accompanied by badges in order to specify their intentions, point out their semantics more clearly or to stay consistent in a range of variants. On principle icons should be designed to be as generic as possible; badges that modify the icons to be more specific will break this principle to a certain degree. Therefore use icons with badges sparingly.

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_15.png

Badges are always placed at the bottom right corner of the file. It is allowed to place them outside of the safe area, if the space is needed. Be aware that badges should be limited in an own safe area of 6x6px.

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_13.png

The badge should be placed near the base glyph while making sure that enough content of the original icon is identifiable. If the icon has multiple variants with badges, make sure that these are aligned on the same baseline (either top or bottom of the badge).

Typeface
========
Use Source Sans Pro bold, if you want your Icon to be only a letter. Remember to morph the font to paths and fill the safe area. Check for pixel crispness. Use special characters (?,!,+,-, …) found in the halflings set, if you need those. If you need to use letters and numerics that accompany a glyph (e.g. for doc type, modifiers, specification of a glyph), design them pixel by pixel using a safe-area of 3x5px and a stroke size of 1px.

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_11.png
   :alt: Use a safe area of 3x5px for characters within a glyph.


Placement of an Icon
====================
If an icon has a thin character or needs a fair length to get recognized or to look great (not cramped), angle it by 45° (e.g. pen or pin). If the point of action is at the bottom, angle the icon 45°. If the point of action is at the top, angle the icon -45°.

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_07.png
   :alt: Angle the icon accordingly to its point of action

Placement within the Safe Area
------------------------------
The icon system follows rules for placement within the safe area in order to ensure a consistent alignment throughout the interface.

1. The icons are placed at or near the center of the safe area
2. If 1 is horizontally not possible, the icons are left-aligned.
3. If 1 is vertically not possible, the icons are placed at the bottom of the safe area.
4. Watch out: Modifiers or related icons can influence the above rules.

.. figure:: images/iconography_styling_12.png
   :alt: Place the icon within the safe area by following the above rules

Bleeding the Safe Area
----------------------
The safe area has a size of 12x12px. It is allowed to use the whole safe area for icon distribution and placement. Nonetheless you should try to distribute the bleeding so that the first rule of `Placement within the Safe Area`_ is followed. If bleeding is necessery because of multiples of glyphs within a single icon, it is recommended to not reposition the original base glyph used. Follow rule 2 and 3 of `Placement within the Safe Area`_.
