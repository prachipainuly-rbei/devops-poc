Guidelines
==========

Guidelines is where the best practices for specific features of the general product design (design principles, accessibility, data entry, navigation, etc.) live.

They will provide a high-level explanation of how relevant components and styles are applied in each scenario. Meanwhile, the components which compose the particular aspect will be documented in the :doc:`design_system_components` section.

The guidelines also supply inspiration for new design patterns and components. Hence the design system is flexible and growing as you can contribute to it by collaborating and interpreting the guidelines in your customized component.
