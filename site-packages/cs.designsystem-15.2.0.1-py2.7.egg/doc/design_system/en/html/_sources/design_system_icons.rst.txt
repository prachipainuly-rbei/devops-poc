Icons
=====

This section documents the official CONTACT Elements UI icon assets.
Information is provided on how to use and extend the Iconset.

Iconography is an effective approach to communicate information and context visually. The design of the icons utilizes metaphors and should remain consistent in these metaphors.

The icons should harmonize with the brand language, such as the semantic :doc:`design_system_styles_color`, :doc:`design_system_styles_typography` etc.. On the other hand, the design of the icons should also yield a simple visual representation to reduce the cognitive load on users. Therefore we focus on generalizing the glyph to produce a modern, flat and simple look and feel.

Besides, icons should be used sparingly in the interface to keep clarity and avoid cognitive overload. A good design should disambiguate and specify the context through the overall user interface.

In the design and usage of the icons we pay close attention to the following aspects:

- **Affordance**: From the usability perspective, a clickable icon should contain this feature in its appearance. You can use the icon button component.
- **Flexibility**: The glyphs should keep a consistent design language. They can be reused and fitted in different contexts.
- **Distinction**: The glyphs differentiate from each other and their appearances (in the component) can be distinguished by users.

We supply the icon source data in svg with a 1:1 proportion to the original design. By doing so, icons are pixel-perfect rendered and behave responsively in the interface.

.. TBD: product icons, such as file client, CDB/PO/WS/GPLM .ico
