A collection of resources for working with and extending the design system.

Design Kit
==========

The design kit is a set of living documents (sticker sheet) that contains all visual assets (icons, color palette, typography, components and page templates etc.). By using the design kit, you can start off creating concepts using the Elements components in a breeze.

We encourage you to download the document in your preferred format and start prototyping regardless of your design skill level. You can also print the document, cut off the components and make paper prototypes.
