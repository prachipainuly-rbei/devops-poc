Using Icons in Design
#####################

This page gives guidelines for using icons in interaction design for CONTACT Elements UI applications and components.


Category of Usage
=================

There are currently five categories of usage.

- Visualizing an **object** or its status, e.g. the lock status of a document, CAD document
- Triggering an **operation**, which calls for either an (simple) action or an (complicated) event, e.g. "create" icon button, "share" icon in the dropdown menu.
- Representing the **toggle** status and capable of switching between the status, e.g. "triangle" icon to collapse and expand a tree structure.
- Serving as a **navigation** entry, e.g. the entry to the Tasks application through the navigation sidebar
- Assisting the UI elements as a **utility** icon, e.g. "X" icon to close the modal.


.. note:: Icons may appear differently depending on the contexts even in the same category, e.g. "Triangle" and "Favorite" as toggle icons appear differently.

.. note:: Icons may also be used in different categories, e.g. "Favorite" as toggle and object icon.

Object
------

An object icon is a static icon that visualizes an object or its status.

Operation
---------

An operation icon triggers an operation, which calls for either an (simple) action or an (complicated) event.

It can be used in different contexts such as buttons, menus, links etc.

Toggle
------

A toggle icon represents the status of an object like an object icon. However, it is clickable and switches between the status.

Navigation
----------

A navigation icon provides the entry to the application and global navigational function such as notification, object favorite.

They can be found in the title bar and navigation bar, which are branded accordingly by the product, e.g. CIM Database, Workspaces, Project Office.

Utility
-------

A utility icon is an assistive part of the user interface. Its metaphor is well established due to the massive usage.

The utility icons are gray so that they appear less irritating and stimulating.

.. note:: The affordance of utility icons is sacrificed, but they are still intuitive to use due to their history and popularity.

Wrong Usage of Icons
====================

- **Pure visual appeal** Icons should be meaningful and intentional.

- **Misuse of an object icon as operation icon** Mind the difference between a static and interactive icon.
