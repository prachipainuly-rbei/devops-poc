Feature: Managing Calendar admin

As an admin I want to manage calendarprofiles


Scenario: admin adds a new day-type
    WHEN admin creates a new day-type
    THEN a new day-type exists

Scenario: admin creates a new calendar profile
    WHEN admin creates a new profile for 2 days
    THEN a new profile exists
        AND new calendar-entries for two days exist

Scenario: admin creates a new calendar exception
    GIVEN there is no calendar exception at "13.07.2012"
    WHEN admin creates a calendar exception at "13.07.2012" for the "Standard" calendar profile
    THEN a new calendar exception exists

Scenario: import from ics
    GIVEN there is no calendar exception at "18.06.2014"
        AND there is no calendar exception at "25.06.2014"
    WHEN admin imports 2 calendar-exceptions from an ics-file
    THEN two new calendar-exceptions exist
