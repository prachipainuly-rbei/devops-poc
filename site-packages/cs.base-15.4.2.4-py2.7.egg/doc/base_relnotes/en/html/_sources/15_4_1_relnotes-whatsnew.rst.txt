Audit Trail
===========

:guilabel:`Audit Trail` is a component for capturing and comparing changes to business objects. In addition to
capturing creation of objects, modifying and deleting, status changes can also be recorded (if the object has a
status log).
If desired the :guilabel:`Audit Trail` can replace the change and status log.

Semantic Links
==============

Enhanced the functionality of the :guilabel:`Link Graph` with filter options for objects and semantics, added
additional object detail information and an overall better performance.
