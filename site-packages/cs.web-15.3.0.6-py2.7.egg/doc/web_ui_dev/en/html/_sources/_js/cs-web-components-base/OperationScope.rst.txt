Description
===========



The OperationScope provides a context for the execution of kernel operations
across a hierarchy of components.

Using the React Context, OperationScope provides a function for components
to register themselves as OperationHandlers. OperationTrigger components
use the surrounding OperationScope to trigger operation execution for
operation handlers, registered in the scope.
