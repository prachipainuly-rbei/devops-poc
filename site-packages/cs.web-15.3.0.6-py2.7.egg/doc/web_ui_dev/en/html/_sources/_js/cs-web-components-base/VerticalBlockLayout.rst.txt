Description
===========

Layout that renders 1, 2, or 3 vertical blocks and behaves as following:
 - each of the children components will be rendered into a block
 - if there are more than 3 children components passed in, only the first three
   ones get rendered
 - in case the height of this layout component changes, it will change the
   height of the last block to fit in, and fix the heights of the other
   blocks

This component will hide the overflowed content and not show scrollbar.
It is the responsibility of the child component to handle its size
and overflow.
