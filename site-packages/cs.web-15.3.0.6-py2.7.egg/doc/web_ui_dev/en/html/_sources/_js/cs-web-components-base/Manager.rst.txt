Description
===========



The Manager function is responsible for creating a table component based
on a set of options, that control the different features and controls of
this component.

The components used in specifying options are usually feature modules, that
pack all options relevant to this feature into one module, so that it can be
easily used in the definition of a table component. For details on how these
feature components are implemented, see section
:ref:`cs-web-components-base.table.Manager.sec_custom_ext`.

options are provided as an Object that contains an entry for each type of
feature that may be activated. The different types for which feature components
may be specified are:

- **Table:** The **Table** option allows to specify a React component that
  overrides the default  table renderer component. The default component used
  here is :ref:`cs-web-components-base-table.Table.__module__`. Usually you do not
  want to provide your own component here.
- **providers:** A list of **Providers**. These omponents alter the way in
  which table data is rendered. Providers are HOCs which are instantiated in
  reverse order in which they occur in the provided list, with **Table** as
  the base component. As a result of this,. properties flow from the first
  listed provider to the last, which finally passes it to the **Table**
  component.
- **columnActions:**
- **toolbarButtons:**

Writing custom extensions
-------------------------

A table feature such as
:ref:`cs-web-components-base-table.sortable.index.__module__` is usually provided
as a module which exports the different options provided to realize the
feature, such as column actions or a provider.
