Description
===========

A plugin container component to show objects related in some way to the
contextObject. Which objects should be displayed is configured in the backend
in the 'Assigned objects' configuration.

The objects are displayed as small 'tiles', where the tiles are dynamically
determined React components, based on the class of the objects (ie. the
``discriminator`` in the plugin configuration must be a class name, see
:ref:`web_ui_plugins` for details). The tile components receive the object
they must render in their ``contextObject`` property.
