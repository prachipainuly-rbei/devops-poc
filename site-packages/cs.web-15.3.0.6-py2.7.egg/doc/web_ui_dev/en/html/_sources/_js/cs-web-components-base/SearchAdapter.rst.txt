Description
===========



The SearchAdapter interface is used as an Interface between the ToolbarSearch
widget and arbitrary components that want to support searching. The interface
may be used to encapsulate arbitrary search algorithms.

The actions provided by the widget are the following (function names in
SearchAdapter):

- onSendQuery: invoked when a query should be sent. returns a promise on success
- nextResult: invoked when next result should be displayed.
- previousResult: invoked when previous result should be displayed.
- cancelSearch: clear results.

The toolbar updates the state of the navigationstate according to the return
value of the function, which will be invoked when the promises returned by the
interface are resolved:

- getNavigationState: returns a JSON object containing boolean values for:

  - previousResult
  - nextResult

TODO use immutable.map for search results
