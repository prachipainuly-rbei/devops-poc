Description
===========



This module provides a HOC that provides functionality to display
and hide overlays as a result of user interaction.

The main point of this HOC is the ``onHide`` callback. This will allow you to
close the overlay according to user's expectations:

- Either by pressing the ``Escape`` key, when the overlay is focused
- or by focusing another element.

Note that the actual visibility state has to be stored by the user, so you are
able to handle the ``onHide`` callback to your liking.

Removed React Properties
========================

- onBlur: Used for ``onHide``.
