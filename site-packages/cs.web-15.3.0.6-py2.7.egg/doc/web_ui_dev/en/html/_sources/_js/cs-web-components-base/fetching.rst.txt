.. _`cs-web-components-base-actions.fetching.singleFetch`:

singleFetch
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

      singleFetch(url: string, callOnce: func)

**Takes:**

- *url*: URL to fetch from

- *callOnce*: Callback that is invoked on successful fetching

Wrapper around getJSON that manages multiple simultaneous GET
requests for a URL. A request is uniquely identified by its URL and
may be in three states:

- Unknown: There is currently no pending request for this state.
- Pending: A request is pending, subsequent calls to singleFetch
  yield the Promise associated with this URL
- Error: A request was done for the URL and failed.

Since each call to the returned promise's then will be executed
(multiple times if the user code is called multiple times) parameter
callOnce allows to attach a callback that is invoked only once this
Promise is fulfilled.

The signature of callOnce is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   callOnce(data) => result|Promise
