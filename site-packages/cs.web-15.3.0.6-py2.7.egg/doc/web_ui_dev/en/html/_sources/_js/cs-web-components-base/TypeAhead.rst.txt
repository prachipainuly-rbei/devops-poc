Description
===========

This class provides a
:ref:`cs-web-components-base-overlays.Dropdown.__default__`-based
component to add type-ahead functionality to input fields.

Key differences to standard Dropdowns are:

- A different layout function. You can not specify a horizontal
  alignment, instead the components width will always be the same
  as the width of the toggle.
- The grabFocus property is set to true, as text input fields will
  usually want to keep the focus on the input field itself.

For properties and usage info, see
:ref:`cs-web-components-base-overlays.Dropdown.__default__`.
