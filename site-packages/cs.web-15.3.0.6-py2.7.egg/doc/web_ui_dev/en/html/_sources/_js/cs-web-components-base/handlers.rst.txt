detail page address will be added to the system's history.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Handle legacy failure handler functions.

This will emulate the behaviour of failure handler functions as used
in cs.web 15.2.0 and cs.web 15.2.1. Please note that full compatibility
can not be ensured, and should be tested when porting to cs.web 15.3.0.

.. _`cs-web-components-base-operations.actions.handlers.handleOperationSuccess`:

handleOperationSuccess
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Default handler for successful operation execution.

Inspects the ``result_type`` field of the operation
result and dispatches an action accordingly:

- ``NO_TYPE``: No action is taken.
- ``OBJECT``: The received object is dispatched to the
  Redux Store.
- ``HTML_VIEW``: The browser navigates to the url provided
  in the operation result by setting ``window.location``.

Other available result types are currently not supported
and will result in a warning being issued.

- *options*: Configuration object

A Handler for successful operation execution.

Navigate to the location specified by path. If path is undefined, try to
use the field web_ui_link of the result.

If option pushHistory is set, this handler will use ``browserHistory.push``
instead of setting ``window.location``.
