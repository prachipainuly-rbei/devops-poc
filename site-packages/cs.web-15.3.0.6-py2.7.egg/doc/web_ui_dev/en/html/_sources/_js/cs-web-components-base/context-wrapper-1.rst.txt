Description
===========

``ContextObjectWrapper`` takes the object(s) stored under the selection named
by the property ``readPath``, and supplies them as ``contextObjects`` to its
single wrapped child component. The last object in that list (or undefined if
the list is empty) is supplied as ``contextObject``. This tracks the behaviour
of selection in tables: the last object in the list is the last that has been
selected.

In addition, an ``onSelect`` callback is supplied, that serves to set a
dependent selection. The name of that selection is formed by appending the
value of the property ``setTag`` to ``readPath``, separated by ``/``.
