Description
===========

FACC component that realizes dynamic loading of JS files. The child function
is called with a boolean argument, that is true iff the script is loaded.
If more than one DynamicLibLoader instance is rendered with the same scriptUrl
property, the library is loaded only once, and the setup funtion is also called
only once.
