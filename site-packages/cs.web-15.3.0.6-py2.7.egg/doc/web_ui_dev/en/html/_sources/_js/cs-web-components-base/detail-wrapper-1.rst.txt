Description
===========

DetailWrapper determines the current objects URL from a base URL provided by
the backend, and the routing params provided in the props. When mounted, or
when the object URL changes, an action to fetch the current object from the
REST API is dispatched.

The current object is provided as property ``contextObject`` to the single
child.

This component is normally not used by itself, but is automatically
employed by the frontend routing.
