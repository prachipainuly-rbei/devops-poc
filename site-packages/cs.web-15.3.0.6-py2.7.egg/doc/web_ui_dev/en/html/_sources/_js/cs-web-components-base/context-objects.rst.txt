.. _`cs-web-components-base-actions.context-objects.setContextObjectList`:

setContextObjectList
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

      setContextObjectList(path: string, values: Immutable.List)

**Takes:**

- *path*: Path to store the selection for, segments separated by '/'

- *values*: A list of (mixed) objects or strings, a string
       is assumed to be the @id of an object

Store a list of selected objects for a path. The path is used to retrieve the
objects from the store. We always store the @id's of the objects, not the objects
themselves, to avoid stale object states.

Objects not already present in the store will be fetched, so that not every
using component has to do this.

.. _`cs-web-components-base-actions.context-objects.setContextObjectsBatchLoad`:

setContextObjectsBatchLoad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

      setContextObjectsBatchLoad(path: string, values: Immutable.List)

**Takes:**

- *path*: Path to store the selection for, segments separated by '/'

- *values*: A list of object identifiers [@id, restname, keys}]

Store a list of selected objects for a path. The path is used to retrieve the
objects from the store. We always store the @id's of the objects, not the objects
themselves, to avoid stale object states.

Objects not already present in the store will be fetched, so that not every
using component has to do this.

The objects will be fetched from the server by a single call.
