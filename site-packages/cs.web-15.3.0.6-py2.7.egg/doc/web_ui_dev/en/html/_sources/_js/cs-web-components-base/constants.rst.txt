.. _`cs-web-components-base-form.constants.ButtonActions`:

**ButtonActions**: The possible actions that a pre-submit dialog can associate with buttons. The
values must match the corresponding constants in the backend (see class
cs.web.components.ui_support.frontend_dialog.FrontendDialog), to avoid another
translation step.

.. _`cs-web-components-base-form.constants.OperationMode`:

**OperationMode**: Internal modes for a component that shows a UI to perform a backend operation.
The UI will typically reflect the current mode in the way it renders, and which
actions are available to the user.
:ref:`cs-web-components-base-form.containers.OperationHandler.__module__`
Components may access the current mode of the operation via
``props.operationState.get('mode')``.

Possible values are:

- INITIAL: Default mode, no user interaction yet
- STARTING: Set when runOperation is called, but state has not been initialized
- STARTED: The user started an operation, interactions with the operation's UI
  are happening here
- SUCCEEDED: The operation has been successfully completed.
- FAILED: The execution of the operation has failed.
- CANCELLED: The operation has been cancelled by the user.

The values ``SUCCEEDED``, ``FAILED`` and ``CANCELLED`` will be reset directly
after it has been propagated to the operation handler via ``componentWillReceiveProps``.

.. _`cs-web-components-base-form.constants.ResultType`:

**ResultType**: These constants correspond to CDB::IOperation::ResultType, defined in
src/cdbidl/CDBIOperation.idl.
