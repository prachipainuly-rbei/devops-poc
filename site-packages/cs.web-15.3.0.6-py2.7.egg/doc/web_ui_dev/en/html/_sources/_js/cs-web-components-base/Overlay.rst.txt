Description
===========

This provides a basic overlay implementation, without any layouting functionality.
It simply renders its child component in a div, positioned absolutely on the document
by using ``React.createPortal``.

Children
========

As children a single element should be passed. This element will be rendered as the content
of the overlay.

 onBlur          function                Sets an ``onBlur`` handler on the overlay div
                                         This is useful if you want to close the div
                                         when it loses focus. Note that for this to
                                         work, you need to initially request the focus
                                         on the component.
 onFocusOut      function                Sets an onFocusOut handler on the overlay div.
                                         Note that this uses DOM Events instead of
                                         React Events (as of 16.3 React does not support
                                         focusin/focusout events).
 setOverlayRef   function                Callback to receive a reference to the overlay
                                         DOM element, e.g., to request the focus, when
                                         it is rendered.
 setContentRef   function                Callback to receive a reference to the content
                                         of the overlay.
 visible         boolean                 The overlay is only rendered if this flag is
                                         ``true``
 positionStyle   object                  This allows to set the element style of the
                                         overlay div, use this to absolutely position
                                         the div on the page
 className       string                  Append additional classes to the overlay's
                                         class attribute.
