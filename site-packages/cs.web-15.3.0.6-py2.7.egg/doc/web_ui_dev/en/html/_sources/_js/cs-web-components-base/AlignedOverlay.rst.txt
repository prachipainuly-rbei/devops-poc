.. contents:: Local Navigation
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Description
===========

Extended Overlay that handles layouting. A layouting function needs to be provided to
calculate the styling/positioning of the overlay. The overlay will then be positioned
in relation to the property ``parentRef``. Exact positioning is determined by
``layoutFunc``.

Layout Function
===============

.. code-block::

   layoutFunc(
     layoutConfig: object,
     horizontalAlign: HorizontalAlignment,
     verticalAlign: VerticalAlignment,
     parentRect: object,
     overlayRect: object,
   ) => object

Functions provided as a layouting function to this component must accept the following
parameters:

- **layoutConfig**: Parameters that depend on the layout function used
- **horizontalAlign**: The horizontal alignment of the overlay
- **verticalAlign**: The vertical alignment of the overlay
- **parentRect**: An object with the absolute position and the dimensions of the parent component.
- **overlayRect**: An object with the dimensions of the content of the overlay.

The return value should be an object, containing at least properties ``top`` and ``left``,
which specify the absolute position of the overlay in ``document.body``. Since the return value
is passed as the element-style of the overlay diff, it is also possible to use CSS for advanced
options, like enabling scrolling.

Children
========

As children a single element should be passed. This element will be rendered as the content
of the overlay.

 parentRef         element                   The element to which the overlay will be
                                             aligned.
 onBlur            function                  Sets an ``onBlur`` handler on the overlay div
                                             This is useful if you want to close the div
                                             when it loses focus. Note that for this to
                                             work, you need to initially request the focus
                                             on the component.
 setOverlayRef     function                  Callback to receive a reference to the overlay
                                             DOM element, e.g., to request the focus, when
                                             it is rendered.
 setContentRef     function                  Callback to receive a reference to the content
                                             of the overlay.
 visible           boolean                   The overlay is only rendered if this flag is
                                             ``true``
 className         string                    Append additional classes to the overlay's
                                             class attribute.
 useTimer          boolean                   If set, a timer will check for responsive
                                             changes and trigger relayouting if necessary
 layoutFunc        function                  A function that calculates the position/layout
                                             of the overlay, based on its content, the
                                             window dimensions and an optional container
 horizontalAlign   HorizontalAlignmentType   The horizontal alignment of the component.
                                             Will be passed as a parameter to the layout
                                             function.
 verticalAlign     VerticalAlignmentType     The vertical alignment of the component.
                                             Will be passed as a parameter to the layout
                                             function.
