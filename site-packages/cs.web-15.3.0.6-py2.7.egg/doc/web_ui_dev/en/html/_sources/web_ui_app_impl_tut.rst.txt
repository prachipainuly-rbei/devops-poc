Implementing Web Applications
#############################

This chapter explains the individual steps to develop an
application. This process is usually started by creating a skeleton
application using the application generation  option of
``webmake``. Use of the script and its different options are
described in :ref:`web_ui_app_impl_tut_age`.

Section :ref:`web_ui_app_impl_tut_layout` explains the default layout
used for |elements| web applications, which is created in the
respective application folder after issuing ``webmake create``.

The process of application development itself can be divided into
creation of the backend (see :ref:`web_ui_app_impl_tut_backend`) and
frontend (see :ref:`web_ui_app_impl_tut_frontend`).  The backend
provides configuration and data for the frontend, while the frontend
determines how an application is rendered in the browser.

Internationalization and localization of resources is
explained in :ref:`web_ui_app_impl_tut_i18n`.

The last section -- :ref:`web_ui_app_impl_tut_customize` -- explains
how the application properties provided by ``BaseApp`` can be
customized by applications, to extend or modify the application frame.
