.. _`web_ui_history`:

Recently Used Objects
=====================

The system provides a REST call to store objects that have been recently used
by the user. This call is, e.g. used by the standard detail view of an object.
Administrators can have a look at the entries actually stored by selecting
:menuselection:`Administration/Configuration --> Configuration --> User interface
--> Web UI --> User Settings/Data --> Recently Used` in the navigation menu.

There are 2 :guilabel:`Default Dettings` that change the behaviour of :guilabel:`Recently Used`.
The setting ``csweb.max_history_objs`` defines the maximum number
of :guilabel:`Recently Used` entries for each user. The setting ``csweb.history_objs_per_class``
defines the number of :guilabel:`Recently Used` entries per class.

The standard settings allow the user to overwrite these entries using the
:guilabel:`Personal Settings` operation.
