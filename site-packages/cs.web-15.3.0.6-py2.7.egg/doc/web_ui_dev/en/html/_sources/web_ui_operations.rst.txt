.. _`operations_webui`:

Kernel operations and the Web UI
################################

There is an API that allows an application developer to run operations in the
way the |win.client| does. This means you get a form generated
from the :guilabel:`Mask configuration` where you can enter your data and run
the operation by pressing the button. At this time there are many
:ref:`restrictions <operations_webui_restrictions>`
using this approach compared to the behaviour of the |win.client|.
Because of these restrictions there is a separate
:ref:`configuration <operations_webui_activation>` if an operation
can be used this way with the Web UI.
