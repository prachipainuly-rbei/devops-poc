Web UI Development
##################

This document describes the libraries, tools and mechanisms provided by
|elements| to create web applications running in a web browser. They are used
by |contact| to develop solutions, but are also available to customers and
3rd party developers.

Concepts
********

The |elements| Web UI consists of applications, components that are used to
assemble applications, and tools to build both of these. In more detail, the
Web UI provides

* A generic UI running in a web browser.

* Components that implement generally useful functionality for |elements|
  applications.

* Methods to configure applications. This applies not only to the configuration
  of single components, but also to the assembly of applications out of these
  components.

* Tools, guidelines and templates for the development of components and
  applications.

* Backwards compatibility with the native client: re-use of existing UI
  configuration (dialogs, tables, catalogs etc.) in web applications.
