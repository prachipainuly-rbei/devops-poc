Conflicting Properties in configured Components
###############################################

Note that when developing applications using the json-based
configuration for pages, the components that are directly configured
into the site are automatically provided with several properties,
e.g. from ``react-router`` or the ``contextObject`` property. These
properties may clash with locally defined properties that are not
specified for the components. If properties are passed down via the
Spread-Operator, even components further down in the component
hierarchy may be affected. If you experience unusual behaviour due to
properties having unexpected value, you should have a look at the
properties passed to your components from the configuration framework.
