cs.activitystream 15.3.0
================================================================================


Renamed Powerscript API
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The module ``cdb.objects.blog`` has been moved to ``cs.activitystream.objects``.
Please make sure to change all calls accordingly.

Additionally, the return value of ``Posting.getTopicCondition`` has been
changed. The returned string now includes ``{0}`` placeholders for use with
``str.format`` instead of a single ``%s`` placeholder. You will have to change
your calls effectively like this:


.. code-block:: python

    # cs.activitystream 15.2.0 and older
    cdb.objects.blog.Posting.getTopicCondition() % my_topic_id

    # cs.activitystream 15.3.0
    cs.activitystream.objects.Posting.getTopicCondition().format(my_topic_id)


Feature Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local images files can be uploaded to a posting or comment during creating one. The
first image will be displayed as thumbnail directly under posting text. Click on it
will open the gallery view of all images.

Attaching objects to a posting or comment is only allowed during creating the posting
or comment. The existing postings or comments can not be changed any more. Create new
comment to attach objects afterwards.
