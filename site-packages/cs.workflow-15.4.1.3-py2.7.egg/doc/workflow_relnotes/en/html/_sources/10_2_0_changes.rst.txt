.. _`10_2_0_changes`:

Changes in cs.workflow 10.2.0
#############################


Task Structure
==============

Regular Tasks can now be used as top-level Tasks in Workflows. Previously, these
had to be wrapped in top-level Task Groups.


.. _`changes_statuschange`:

Status Changes
==============

In previous versions, running and stopping (e.g. canceling and dismissing)
Workflows were tightly coupled to the Workflow's status change operation. Now,
they are dedicated operations, which will execute all necessary status changes.
Status changes can not be executed manually on Workfows anymore.
