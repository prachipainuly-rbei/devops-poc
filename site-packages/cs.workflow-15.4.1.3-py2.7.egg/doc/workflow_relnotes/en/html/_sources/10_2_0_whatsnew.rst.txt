Additions
#########

The following features have been added to cs.workflow in version 10.2.0:


System Tasks
============

With System Tasks, you can define Workflow Tasks that require no user
interaction. They can perform any automatable task, and even run custom code.


Workflow Service
================

A |cdb| service (Message Queue) that runs System Tasks.


.. _`whatsnew_infomessages`:

Information Messages
====================

Messages are a new class of objects replacing Information Tasks. They are
automatically generated whenever a System Task of type "Information" is ready.
Messages are displayed by the Task Manager just like Information Tasks were.


Constraints
===========

Constraints bringt together Workflow Tasks and Object Rules. Whenever a Task
would be ready, all Object Rules referenced by its Constraints are checked, and
potentially cancel the Task (see cs.workflow manual).


Briefcases
==========

Briefcases are folder objects, and can contain objects to be used, modified, or
created inside a Workflow. They also help Tasks communicate with each other.
Briefcases replace the previously used Object Roles.


Workflow Designer
=================

The Workflow Designer is a new eLink application. You can easily create
Workflows, and also visualize running or already completed Workflows. It
replaces the "Ad Hoc Workflow Designer", and complements the usual structure
view.
