cs.workflow 15.4.1.3
====================

Map Names of Inactive Users and Roles Correctly
-----------------------------------------------

This change introduces the view ``cdbwf_resp_mapping``, which is basically a
functional copy of ``cdbwf_resp_browser`` without the WHERE conditions.

This enables workflow tasks to map the names of their responsible roles and
persons even if they have been marked organizational or deactivated after the
fact and are not usable as responsibles for new tasks.

.. note::
    To enable this fix, revert any patches for the ``cdbdd_field`` entries for
    classname ``cdbwf_process_component`` and field name
    ``mapped_subject_name*``.

cs.workflow 15.4.1.2
====================

Initial Render of Workflow Designer Doesn't Scale Well
------------------------------------------------------

Several optimizations reduce the runtime required for initially rendering the
Workflow Designer of large workflows:

- Most objects are now instantiated in a single pass per class,
- initial rendering does not wait for images and responsible catalog data to be
  loaded.

The most important optimizations, however, will not be available per default,
as they potentially disrupt customizing.

.. warning::
    Please see :ref:`Optional Performance Optimization<wfadmin:optional_performance_optimization>`
    for how to use these optimizations in your environment.
