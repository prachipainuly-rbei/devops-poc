cs.workflow 10.2.1 Release Notes
################################

cs.workflow 10.2.1 adds the following functionality to :guilabel:`cs.workflow`:


Frozen Workflows
================

Using the new operation "Freeze Workflow", you can pause Workflows indefinitely
(for details, see manual). The Workflow's status becomes "frozen", and a
corresponding flag ("parent Workflow is frozen yes/no") is added to its Tasks.


Object Life Cycle for Workflow Templates
========================================

Workflow templates now have their own Object Lifecycle (for details, see
manual).

  .. note::
    cs.workflow 10.2.1 will run the update script
    "cs.workflow.updates.v10_2_1_0", which will set the status of all Workflow
    Templates that are not "dismissed" to "approved".


Limiting Users' Choice of Templates
===================================

Depending on a Workflow Template's Tasks, it may not be suitable for certain
objects. For example, a template including a status change can only be used with
objects that have an Object Lifecycle.

You can now assign Object Rules to Workflow Templates to enforce these
limitations (for details, see manual).


Updated Relationship Profiles
=============================

Profiles for Relationships between cs.workflow objects have been updated. Your
contact at |contact| will assist you in updating your custom modifications.


Customizing Tasks
=================

Tasks can now more easily be customized to fit your needs. Please ask your
contact at |contact| for further details.


Service Level 11
================

Starting with Service Level 11, the Access Control Domain "cdbwf: All Tasks"
grants the Common Role "public" the access right "accept".

.. _`10_2_1_cancel_info_on_failure`:

Service Level 14
================

This service level changes the visibility of information messages of canceled
and failed workflows. These are no longer filtered by the object rule in
|cs.taskmanager|.

To emulate the old behavior, follow these steps:

- Set the default setting `cs.workflow`, `cancel_info_on_failure` to `1` (or
  create it in the first place).
- Information messages that are not part of a workflow's completion task is
  deactivated when the workflow is canceled or fails (
  `cdbwf_info_message.is_active` is set to `0`).

Existing workflows can be migrated using the optional update script
`cs/workflow/updates/tools/deactivate_obsolete_info_messages.py`.
