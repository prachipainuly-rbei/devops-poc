Service Levels
##############


Changes in Service Level 8
==========================


Updated System Tasks
--------------------

Each System Task now starts its own process, using the account of the person who
started the Workflow. This user is written to the Workflow's new attribute
:envvar:`started_by` when started.

For Workflows that are already running, the Workflow owner will be written to
:envvar:`started_by`, if it is a person.

Workflows owned by a role will not be migrated. You will have to provide a value
for :envvar:`started_by` manually to be able to run System Tasks inside this
Workflow.


Updates Status Change Tasks
---------------------------

Status Change Tasks now also take input from Information Briefcases.

When a status change for an object fails, it is attempted for the other objects,
then the Status Change Task's status becomes `canceled`.


Changes in Service Level 15
===========================


Changed Powerscript References :envvar:`Previous` and :envvar:`Next`
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Powerscript References
:envvar:`cs.workflow.schemacomponents.SchemaComponent.Previous` and
:envvar:`cs.workflow.schemacomponents.SchemaComponent.Next` now return the
following:

- :envvar:`Previous` returns the Workflow's Task or Task Group that triggered
  the calling object's status change.
- :envvar:`Next` returns the Workflow's Task or Task Group that was/will be
  triggered by the calling object.


Changes in Service Level 16
============================


Default Task Titles and Owners
------------------------------

Whenever a Workflow starts, it sets the title of all Tasks that do not currently
have one to its Task Type (Execution, Approval, or Review).

It will also check if all Tasks have an owner ("Responsible" person or Role).
Adding Tasks to already running Workflows can result in a Task becoming ready
that does not have an owner. In this case, the Task's "Responsible"
(``subject_id``) attribute is filled with the Workflow owner when set ready.


``cdb_module_id`` Added to System Task Definitions
--------------------------------------------------

System Task Definitions now use the attribute ``cdb_module_id`` to better
support the Component Architecture.


Automatic Inclusion of Optional Updates
---------------------------------------

Updates classified as "optional" (for example access rights, Object Lifecycles,
Object Rules) will be automatically applied when updating from cs.workflow
10.1.0 to guarantee correct functionality.


Workflow Deadlines
------------------

When starting a Workflow, its starting date will be set. If a max. duration is
set, the Workflow's deadline will be set to starting date + max. duration.


Changes in Service Level 19
===============================


Workflow Service Added to Navigation
------------------------------------

Jobs to be executed by the asynchronous Workflow Service can now be found in the
Navigation panel at
:menuselection:`Administration/Configuration -> Adminstration -> Workflows -> System Task Jobs`.
