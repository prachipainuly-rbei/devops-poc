Deprecations
############


Ad Hoc Workflows
================

Starting with 10.2.0, the two classes ``Managed Processes`` and
``Ad Hoc Workflows`` are combined into the single class Workflows
(``cdbwf_process``).

The eLink application to create "Ad Hoc Workflows" has been replaced
by the new Workflow Designer.

The operations :guilabel:`Ad Hoc Workflow/New` and
:guilabel:`Ad Hoc Workflow/Create from Template` are renamed to
:guilabel:`Workflow/New` and :guilabel:`Workflow/Create from Template`.

The User Exit ``create_ad_hoc_workflow`` is removed. Its operations are now
implemented in the Powerscript class ``cs.workflow.briefcases.BriefcaseContent``
(see Administrator's manual).


Information Tasks
=================

The Task Type "Information" is replaced by :ref:`whatsnew_infomessages`.


Manual Task Groups
==================

Manual Task Groups are removed. Equivalent behavior can be achieved by using
nested parallel and sequential Task Groups (see :ref:`10_2_0_migration`).


Object Roles and Object Rules
=============================

Object Roles and Object Rules are replaced by Briefcases.

Status changes can now be used at any time in a Workflow by using the
corresponding System Task (see :ref:`10_2_0_migration`).

The classes ``cdbwf_p2obj``, ``cdbwf_p2doc``, ``cdbwf_p2mod``, ``cdbwf_p2part``,
``cdbwf_p2task`` and all Relationships they were used in are removed.
