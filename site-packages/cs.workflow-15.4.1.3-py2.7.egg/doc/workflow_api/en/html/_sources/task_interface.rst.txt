Workflow Task
=============

The APIs to manage a workflow object are defined in the standard object class
`cs.workflow.tasks.Task` and an interface class
`cs.workflow.designer.wfinterface.Task`, which enable some advanced APIs
on the standard object class to handle workflow task programmatically. The
task type specific APIs are defined in different derived classes.

.. autoclass:: cs.workflow.tasks.Task
   :members: activate_task,
             cancel_task,
             CloseTask,
             RefuseTask,
             ForwardTask,
             requiresComment

   .. method:: ModifyTask(**kwargs)

        Interface method to modify the current task.
        Checks permissions and executes user exits.

        If the process is already running, the current task must not
        be running or closed. Otherwise an exception is raised.

        :raises: cdb.ue.Exception

   .. method:: DeleteTask()

        Delete the task from the database and from the workflow.
        If needed rearrange the task groups.

        Checks permissions and executes user exits

        If the process is already running, the current task must not
        be running or closed. Otherwise an exception is raised.

        :raises: cdb.ue.Exception

        :return: the most derived unchanged component

.. autoclass:: cs.workflow.tasks.InteractiveTask
   :members: getPossibleExtensions,
                getExtensionObject,
                get_running_tasks_by_briefcase
