-   15.3.0.1

    -   Changed signature of PowerReports API method *WithPowerReports.generate_report*

        Until now the default value of the method parameter *rep_exec_type* has been *Server
        (synchron)* and the default value of the parameter *report_format* has been *Excel*. Both
        default values have been changed to *None*, which in turn now defaults to the report
        configuration values. This means that every usage of the method *generate_report* now either
        has to explicitly pass the wanted report type and format as method parameter values, or the
        wanted report type and format have to be adjusted in the report configuration.
