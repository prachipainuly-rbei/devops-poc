Powerscript API
###############

PowerScript is the development environment of the system,
which enables you to develop add ons, user exits, stand alone scripts or
complex applications based on or integrated with the  |cs.platform|. This document
only describes some API members that are important for the ``cs.powerreports`` package.
Most of the PowerReports API is closely bound to the OfficeLink API and thus described in the
OfficeLink user manual.
