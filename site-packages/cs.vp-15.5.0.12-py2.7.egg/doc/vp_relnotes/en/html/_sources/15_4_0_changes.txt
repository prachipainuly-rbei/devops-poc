What's New in cs.vp 15.4.0?
###########################

Service Level 0
===============

WebUI
-----

With this release there is a new WebUI which supports searching and
viewing of parts.

cdb_cad_assembly_component
--------------------------

The class `cdb_cad_assembly_component` together with its masks, tables
and operations has been removed.

It has been replaced by the class `threed_cad_assembly_component` in the
package `cs.threed`.

Service Level 8
===============

Object Rule ``3D Models``
-------------------------

Starting with this service level, there is now an object rule named ``3D Models``.
It is used to determine the objects which hold 3D data that can be used for
the preview. It will replace the rule ``3D Viewer: Viewable Models`` from
the package ``cs.threed``.

.. important::
    When you have customized the old rule, make sure to apply the same modifications
    to the new rule. This won't happen automatically.
