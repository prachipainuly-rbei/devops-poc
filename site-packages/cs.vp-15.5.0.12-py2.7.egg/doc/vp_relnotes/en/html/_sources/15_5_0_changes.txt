Bugfix E038693: Instantiated assemblies have BOM predicates
-----------------------------------------------------------

With this bugfix BOM predicates and BOM terms are no longer copied when instantiating an
a maxBOM for a variant. This leads to some performance optimization of the MBOM Manager.

If you are using the MBOM Manager, it is important that you clean up your data to remove
any redundant bom predicate, which was created before the bugfix. Use the following tool:

.. code-block:: shell

    powerscript -m cs.vp.bom.tools.delete_redundant_predicates --help
