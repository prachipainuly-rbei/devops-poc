mBOM - Manufacturing BOMs
=========================

Changes to the revision logic of manufacturing BOMs
---------------------------------------------------

With the version 10.2.1 there are less restrictions on mBOM revisions:
a revision of an mBOM part can be associated to any revision of the same eBOM part.

This allows to generate an mBOM for a new eBOM revision by indexing an old
mBOM revision, instead of copying it. Thus the part numbers of the mBOM parts
can be kept the same during the whole revision process.

You can still revision an mBOM of an older eBOM. That is the indexes of an mBOM
part do not have to correspond to the indexes of the eBOM part.
The only restriction is that every index of an mBOM part
should be assigned to an index of the same eBOM part.

Since there is no chronological connection between different indexes of an
mBOM part, it is not necessary to enforce that only the newest index has the
status ``Released``. In particular there are no more automatic status changes
for mBOM parts. This also means that mBOM parts cannot reach the status
``Revision`` anymore.

If you implemented any custom automatic status changes you should check
if they also make sense for mBOM parts and eventually modify them.

mBOM parts which are currently in the status ``Revision`` must be set
to another status via script. mBOM parts cannot leave this status manually.

In order to be able to generate new indexes of mBOM parts some changes
to the rights configuration are necessary. These are done in the new
access control domain ``mBOM: all``.
You should check if this configuration is compatible with your own customized
rights configuration.

The attribute :guilabel:`Copy of` (``cdb_copy_of_item_id``) is now also filled
when creating new indexes.
