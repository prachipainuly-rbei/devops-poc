Responsible
===========

The automatically generated view ``pcs_sharing_subjects_all`` provides the names for persons and roles that are
displayed in business objects, e. g. project tasks, issues, in the field :guilabel:`Responsible`.

Multi language support does exist for :ref:`Common Roles <ce_admin_en:aclandgroups-roles-common>` and PCS Roles.
Multi language support does not apply to persons, because names of persons are not multilingual.
Multiple languages for additional :ref:`Organizational Contexts <ce_admin_en:aclandgroups-contextrights>`
cannot be supported, because the role catalog is unknown.

You can customize the behaviour using the definition of the user defined view
``pcs_sharing_subjects_all``.
