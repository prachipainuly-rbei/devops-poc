New features in version 10.2.0
==============================

The multi-project management functions are the most important new features
of ``cs.pcs`` version 10.2.0. These support the user in distributed planning
of projects and make it possible to create versatile views of project structures.

In addition, this version takes apart the package structure in use to date.
This version spins off the :emphasis:`cs.pcs.resources` and :emphasis:`cs.pcs.sync`
modules into a separate package or removes them completely.

Adjustments in detail
---------------------

* :strong:`Resource management (cs.pcs.resources) spun off`

  The resource management module previously included in ``cs.pcs`` has been spun off
  into a separate ``cs.resources`` package. As a result, different actions are needed
  depending on how the module was used to date:

  If the module was used earlier, ``cs.pcs`` can only be updated together with the
  installation of the new ``cs.resources`` resource management package. The import
  paths for adjustments to Python files remain unchanged in this case.
  
  If, however, the resource management module has not yet been used, the
  components of the outsourced module are automatically removed.

* :strong:`Synchro Links (cs.pcs.sync) removed`

  The ``cs.pcs.sync`` module has been removed in this version because the basic
  functionality is now covered by the ``cs.pcs`` module with the new functions
  for multi-project scheduling. Adjustments that relate to the removed module must
  be removed from the customer-specific Python implementations accordingly.
  In addition, the ``install_requires`` relationships of the packages relating to
  the ``cs.pcs.sync`` module have to be removed.  The removal of the synchro
  links is also automated..

* :strong:`Masks adjusted`

  As part of ongoing development, new attributes have been added to some masks.
  In particular, these changes pertain to the Task and Project masks.
  Here, both the *Data sheet* (main tab) and the detail information have been
  adjusted on the additional tabs. The new masks are maintained so that the most
  important and editable data is on the main tab and all additional information
  for scheduling and expenditures are now located on the detail tab.

  Follow-up work must be carried out on masks with customer-specific adjustments
  so that the newly added fields can be placed at the desired position.

* :strong:`Static time schedule replaced by configurable time schedule`

  The previous solution for scheduling is being replaced by a new HTML5-based solution.
  This new solution is specifically used to support multi-project planning,
  i.e. multiple projects or project sub-structures can now be packaged together and
  edited in any number of plans. For more detailed information on the exact functions
  of the new scheduling solution, refer to the user manual.

* :strong:`Expanded task dependencies replace the Synchro Links`

  Predecessor/successor relationships between tasks can now also be created
  across projects. This allows them to replace Synchro Links, which were
  previously used for cross-project coordination of project tasks.
  The task dependencies are primarily informative in character, i.e. they
  notify the user about schedule-related limits being violated or exceeded but
  do so without preventing associated tasks from being moved.

* :strong:`Inserting PSP code into PCS module`

  Using this version allows you to create a PSP code automatically for projects
  and their tasks. The associated operation for this can be called up on projects
  and also sets the PSP code for all project tasks based on the PSP code of
  the project. If the field is set elsewhere or is already in use, the operation
  should be deactivated in the configuration.

* :strong:`Inserting PSP code into PCS module`

  If the |tm.project| link is used, the affected
  :ref:`synchronization table <msproject-synchrotabelle.png>` must be adapted
  to enable the correct synchronization of the schedule value. More information
  on the configuration options and the
  :ref:`synchronization table <msproject-synchrotabelle.png>` can be found in
  the *OfficeLink administration manual* under *Configuration\\Project\\Server*.
  
.. note::
  A description for the standard configuration values can be found in the
  :ref:`synchronization table <msproject-synchrotabelle.png>`. Please note that
  the table contents specified here are an excerpt of the information to be
  synchronized and must be adjusted where appropriate to achieve the desired data
  synchronization.
  The content of the :ref:`synchronization table <msproject-synchrotabelle.png>`
  is **not** changed automatically during an update!

* :strong:`Update: DataMigrations`

  This update carries out adjustments on the data stock of projects and tasks:

    - Existing task dependencies are re-initiated to correspond to the
      requirements of multi-project management.
    - The values for the *duration* of projects and tasks are re-calculated
      based on the respective data values.
    - The schedule-related limit values for moving tasks with dependencies
      are initiated.

* :strong:`Update: MoveReports`

  This update corrects the assignment of some existing standard reports and moves
  them into the modules provided for them.

* :strong:`Update: GenerateQualityCharacteristics`

  This update creates project KPIs for existing objects. All project KPIs here are
  transferred to the status :guilabel:`valid` if they previously had the status
  :guilabel:`editing`. If no object KPIs have been used yet, the KPIs now set to
  :guilabel:`valid` are calculated for all relevant objects. In order to enable this
  update to be very extensive when running for large amounts of inventory data, all
  of the key performance indicators that are not to be used anyway should be set to
  :guilabel:`invalid` in advance to exclude them from the update.

* :strong:`Update: CreateTimeSchedules`

  The new scheduling solution mentioned above is based on new scheduling objects
  (see user manual). This update creates a standard schedule object for any project that
  has not yet ended. As a result, a schedule object has to be created by hand for
  completed or canceled projects if necessary. In the future, when creating projects,
  a standard schedule plan object will be created automatically.
