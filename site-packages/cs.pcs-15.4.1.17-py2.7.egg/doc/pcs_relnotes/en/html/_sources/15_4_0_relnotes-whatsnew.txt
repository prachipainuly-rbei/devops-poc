What's New in cs.pcs 15.4.0?
############################

Checklist
=========
The checklist refers to changes that require or are recommended for manual actions before or after the update.

The access rights of project folders now have an impact on the assignment of documents (from SL 19)
  The access rights of project folders now have an impact on the assignment of documents to a folder,
  but not on the document itself (from SL 4).
  Relationship access profiles ``CheckCreateFolderDoc`` and ``CheckDeleteFolderDocument`` have been replaced
  by ``cs.pcs: Folder: Document Assignments``.
  The relationship access profiles ``CheckCreateFolderDoc`` and ``CheckDeleteFolderDocument``
  and their configuration remain in the system as unassigned elements. After the update, you must delete
  these elements manually.

New time scheduling features
============================

cs.pcs 15.4.0 comes with new features regarding time scheduling such as scheduling with gaps or 
constraints (early start, etc.). For details please refer to the regarding chapter in the user manual.

  .. note::
    From cs.pcs 15.4.0, tasks get the additional property :guilabel:`Automatic Calculation`.

    The combination of the values :guilabel:`Bottom-Up Values As Target Value` = Yes
    and :guilabel:`Automatic Calculation` = No is not meaningful.
    The results of the buttom-up aggregation and automatically calculated dates are distinguished by the
    properties of the target and buttom-up dates.

    During the update, the :guilabel:`Automatic Calculation` property is set to No for existing tasks.
    This ensures that the update does not change any date of the existing tasks.
    On the other hand, the non-meaningful combination of the values of both properties is accepted for existing tasks.

    The bottom-up date values for projects and tasks will be aggregated by target date values
    and also by bottom-up date values of its subtasks. Projects, that are already finished,
    will not be effected by this change.

New |tm.project| Interface
==========================

There's a new interface for importing and exporting projects via the |tm.project| XML format. For
details please refer to the regarding chapter in the user manual.

  .. note::
    The existing - API based - interface to |tm.project| is now deprecated and will only be supported 
    until CONTACT Elements Platform 15.1. Lately with the update to a CONTACT Elements Platform Version > 15.1 
    customers must also update to the new |tm.project| interface.
