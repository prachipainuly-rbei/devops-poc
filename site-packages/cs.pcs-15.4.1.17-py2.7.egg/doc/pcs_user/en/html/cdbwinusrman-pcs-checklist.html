<span id="cdbwinusrman-pcs-checklist"></span><h1>Checklists, Quality Gates and Deliverables<a class="headerlink" href="#checklisten-quality-gates-und-deliverables" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>In project management, checklists form an interface between content-related work and management. Step by step, they represent processes that are &#8220;checked-off&#8221; when completed while also serving as documentation. For your use cases, such as in product development, checklists help with maintaining methods and allow the use of uniform process models as a &#8220;tool of quality management&#8221;. The use of the term <span class="guilabel">Checklist</span> is equivalent to the use of the terms <span class="guilabel">Quality gates</span> and, to a certain extent, <span class="guilabel">Deliverables</span> below.</p>
<p>Checklists are connected to tasks for which they document and record the quality of the work results in the form of colored identifiers. In the checklists, the work results are rated using checklist items. Checklists and checklist items have to be handled like tasks.</p>
<p>When used in project work, the result of a checklist is displayed with a complete rating of all inspection tasks in the checklist as colored identifiers. In the product development process, this means that project team members can quickly obtain an overview of the state of projects, particularly using the overview in the Checklists folder.</p>
<p>As you may be familiar with from tasks, checklists and checklist items are assigned to a responsible division and a role or person and are provided with a due date if applicable. Other information to be specified includes the rating scheme (e.g. red/yellow/green), weightings (e.g. KO criterion) and descriptive information. If the responsible person rates the last checklist items of a task after completing it, this is shown in the checklist as a result. The task can only be switched to the <em>Completed</em> status once it has been rated.</p>
<p class="rubric">Quality Gates</p>
<p>Quality gates are a special type of checklist. They are not used for individual tasks, but as a transition between project stages. This makes them more important by their very nature. According to the definition of quality gates, they form a barrier between consecutive stages and their being rated as successful is a requirement for starting subsequent stages.</p>
<p>Quality gates are represented by a time signal icon. The checklist items for a quality gate are used for checking the actual state at the end of a project stage. Subsequent tasks can be switched to the <em>Execution</em> status only once the quality gate returns a satisfactory test result, meaning it has been processed successfully.</p>
<p class="rubric">System-Side Effects of Rating Checklists and Quality Gates</p>
<p>Checklists and quality gates are used for documenting and maintaining the quality of work results in the form of text-based quality criteria in conjunction with colored identifiers. The actual rating takes place using lower level checklist items; the detailed process for this is explained below.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the rating results of checklists and quality gates are visually configured using the <span class="guilabel">RedYellowGreen</span> or <span class="guilabel">GermanSchoolmarks</span> rating schemes without any system-side effects in the <span class="guilabel">Project management</span> standard. In other words, continued editing or status changes for an associated task are still possible even with a checklist rated as &#8220;red&#8221;. The same applies to a checklist rated green or yellow.</p>
<p>The task of rating results is to clarify the respective work states and results for persons responsible for the project. Interventions by the system, such as preventing a status change at the task level, have not been implemented. The process model is that unsatisfactory rating results are analyzed, edited and resolved by the persons involved.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that corresponding system operations could be integrated specific to a customer. These could include actions such as implementing a notification service in the event that a quality gate rating is too low or triggering other system-side events that temporarily suspend continued work on a task. The system provides a starting point that can be flexibly adapted according to different requirements.</p>
<p class="rubric">Deliverables</p>
<p>Deliverables are another specialized form of checklists. They use formal criteria to describe the work results that must be provided to complete a task and ensure the deliverables are created in a timely manner. Work results for a task are typically documents that have to be created. Depending on the specific configuration, however, any other technical objects could be used for work results that must be provided.</p>
<p>Deliverables can be specified starting in the project planning stage and used to define which documents and technical objects are to be created at which point in the course of a project and which properties these are to fulfill. A task can be completed only once the work results described by the assigned deliverables have been created and assigned. This allows workflow monitoring for a project to be bound to the provision of formally defined results.</p>
<p>For example, if you must ensure that a cost and resource chart is created before a technical concept is created, you can assign a corresponding deliverable to the task for creating the cost and resource chart. Then you can link the two tasks with an end-start relationship. The task can be completed andâdue to the end-start relationshipâthe subsequent task can be started only once the described documents have been created and assigned to the deliverable.</p>
<p>The documents to be created are displayed via the deliverable&#8217;s <span class="guilabel">Work Objects to be Created</span> relationship. A precise formal description of these documents using document master data is concealed behind these entries. Document properties frequently used here include the category, creating system or status. These descriptions are typically defined in the project templates and requires administration knowledge. You can find additional information, as needed, in the platform administration manual in the <span class="guilabel">Configurable rules</span> section. The required object rules are defined once, by the administrator. The object rules are defined once and then template designers or project managers can use them in project templates or specific projects.</p>
<p>The object rules assigned to a deliverable describe the objects to be created in a manner similar to declarations without having to program declarations. A deliverable is marked complete if you change its status to <em>Completed</em>. All of the associated object rules are evaluated against the technical objects assigned to the deliverable during this process and the status change is rejected if necessary if not all of the object rules are met. An object rule is considered met if at least one technical object with the described properties is assigned directly to the deliverable. The project team member receives a combined error message listing the work objects that are still missing. If a project team member wishes to check if an assigned technical object fulfills the object rule, the team member can use the <span class="guilabel">Show objects</span> operation in the pop-up menu for the object rule to display all of the suitable technical objects. If a technical object meets the rule, it has to appear here.</p>
<p>In addition to object rules, the checklist items you are familiar with from conventional checklists can also be assigned to a deliverable. The checklist items for a deliverable are used for recording criteria that cannot be described using document master data. This frequently relates to content-related aspects that are intended to be checked off as taken into account or implemented during document creation.</p>
<p>All of the checklist items have to be checked off to complete a deliverable. If this is not the case during a status change for the deliverable, then any checklist items that are still unrated are also displayed in the combined message. The created work objects are assigned for documents using the document relationship of a deliverable. Other technical objects to be created are assigned using separate relationships depending on the specific configuration where appropriate.</p>
<p>When using deliverables, it makes sense to provide the necessary document templates directly in the context of the deliverable for later editors. This is particularly useful for standardized project workflows and when using project templates. This frees the editor from having to search and use the template for the document to be created. Instead the editor can find the document in the editing context. A new document can be created from a template by calling the <span class="guilabel">Create new document...</span> pop-up menu function. The created document is then assigned to the deliverable automatically and users can search for it using project filing.</p>
<p>The assigned document templates can optionally be set up so that the document is generated from the templates and assigned to the deliverable automatically in the event the deliverable&#8217;s status is changed to a specific status. The <em>Evaluation</em> status of the deliverable is provided for this. Checklists and deliverables automatically assume this status if the associated task is put <em>Execution</em> and the deliverable is ready for editing. The editor of the task can start editing the document immediately without having to create the document. You can find additional information on using document templates in project structures in the <span class="guilabel">Documents</span> application manual under <span class="guilabel">Document templates in project structures</span>.</p>
