<p id="pcs-teaser">The growing number and increasing complexity of projects are confronting project managers and the Project Management Office (PMO) with ever greater challenges when it comes to realizing the technical aims of the project on-time and within budget. By relieving these actors of routine activities and bookkeeping tasks and by providing sophisticated planning functions and reliable monitoring and control mechanisms, <em>CONTACT Projects</em> offers comprehensive support to both those responsible for the projects and those implementing the projects.</p>
<p>Advanced products are developed today almost exclusively by interdisciplinary and cross-departmental projects. High innovation pressure, among other things, is a typical challenge for these types of development projects. This causes more projects to have to be completed in less time. Insufficient multi-project controlling is another challenge. When facing these challenges, simply adding &#8220;more&#8221; scheduling is not enough. In many cases, planning and monitoring are limited to adapting the long outdated project schedule to reality.</p>
<p>Instead, the goal should be to integrate the knowledge and expertise of the individual responsible project team members. The system, therefore, supports the actual project work along with the project management, i.e. performing tasks to achieve project goals. The term 360° project management is used for this comprehensive view of the project control loop from planning to implementation and monitoring.</p>

<p><em>CONTACT Projects</em> supplies reliable status information, supports a structured procedure for the collaboration of distributed development teams and adds a tool to planning tools like MS Project or controlling instruments like SAP PS that all participants can use to maintain their goals: project managers, project team members and external partners.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual projects are at the foundation of the <span class="guilabel">Project management</span>. As a result, the portfolio of the scheduled and active projects (e.g. from the product research and development department) and the list of already completed projects are logically available centrally for all participants. The project-specific scopes of application and intended uses supported specifically appear as follows:</p>
<p class="rubric">Project Planning Using the Project Structure Plan</p>
<p>A project can be arranged by task (or priority or PSP element) in a hierarchical manner for the purpose of a project structure plan. This type of arrangement, for example, is the basis for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="first">Visualizing all project tasks and contents, their relationships and additional information for project management;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Logically scheduling the project in terms of predecessor/successor relationships between the individual task steps;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Inspecting the task goals using checklists with test criteria or deliverables as documents to be delivered;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Determining important objectives in terms of milestones or so-called quality gates for the purpose of predictive quality planning;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Accurate scheduling and progress control in the project business, displayed as a bar graph;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Resource planning closely connected to scheduling, carried out as demand and capacity planning;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Detailed effort recording and overview of performed tasks;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The multi-faceted analysis of project information using extensive reports that can be used directly or adjusted/advanced accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, there is the option to display single-level project hierarchies. Multiple projects can be assigned to a parent project for this purpose so that they can be displayed together in a project overview. In this process, subordinate projects remain independent of each other so that, for example, distributing project responsibilities and content-related scheduling can take place separately.</p>
<p>The nodes visible in the project overview are the tasks, checklists with checklist items, the project team as well as the parts and project documents assigned to the project. These nodes reflect the technical objects relevant to the project management and, in turn, include expanded information and operations described in more detail in the chapters below. The displayed structured overview makes it possible to access all relevant project information and documents quickly and easily.</p>
<p class="rubric">Collaborative Project Management</p>
<p>In particular, the system supports collaborative project management, i.e. the actual execution of project work and tasks. Thus, it is not only an instrument for project managers but also and primarily for the project team itself. Special functions of this are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="first">Direct access to central work pieces like products, product components, documents, change transactions, etc. in the context of the project; (basis for this is the presence of the corresponding licenses - TV, DOK, MDM etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A logically central task management which takes all tasks that accumulate as part of the project work into account, e.g. from the project structure plan, the open issues or from checklists and inspection lists. Relevant personal or project-related task lists and task lists applicable for all active projects are available to the project team members;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Schedule and resource planning for the project tasks that show the individual project team members all information regarding their tasks, deadlines, planning and workloads in an easy-to-read way. Overall, this allows the option of discussing and planning the pending work tasks in a collaborative manner - supported by the graphic interface for schedule and resource planning.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Effort recording and effort management for controlling project costs in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Various project views and reports that inform the project team member about important project information at a glance in a graphically oriented display.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system is used to manage and utilize work objects like parts, CAD drawings and documents including their descriptive master data and expanded information in a joint project context - as collaborative project management. This means that all work objects can be categorized, managed and made available using one project.</p>
<p>Project views can be configured using filtering and provision options, which allow the project team members quicker access to their edited work objects. However, projects can also be used as security measures by only making all project documents available exclusively to project members.</p>
<p class="rubric">Forward-Looking Quality Assurance</p>
<p>One of the central tasks of project management is to keep the project &#8220;on track&#8221; in terms of its content-related objectives. The system, therefore, supports crucial process models, which put this in focus as part of a forward-thinking quality assurance concept such as APQP or the quality or stage gate method. It added detailed processes here such as product FMEA on the project process level as a whole. The basis of the <span class="guilabel">Project management</span> is provided by the following elements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p class="first">The management and use of project templates. Templates can be defined and stored easily. In the interests of &#8220;Best Practices&#8221;, templates do not only depict tried-and-tested project structure plans, but also typical project roles, quality gates, checklists etc.;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Quality gates that can be connected to selected PSP elements and define at which points of the project plan important partial or intermediate results are to be expected;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Checklists that more closely define the anticipated work results for project tasks and criteria to be met based on checklist items;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Deliverables that enable automatic inspection of documents to be delivered based on rules to be configured;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Filing project-related documents (including CAD documents) in the project folder structure. This has a Drag&amp;Drop capability similar to that familiar from Windows Explorer. Corresponding to the project folder structure, all technical objects of the project can be made available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A foundation for quality assurance is to have all relevant information in view. Therefore, the project overview occupies this role of the &#8220;Cockpits for the project members&#8221; by allowing you to quickly gain an overview of the respective project state.</p>
<p>By navigating, you can easily reach the desired project object to receive the relevant information in detail. The project is the context in which, for instance, the designers, project managers and toolmakers work together. The system provides this context in an easy-to-understand format - ideal for project-oriented work.</p>
