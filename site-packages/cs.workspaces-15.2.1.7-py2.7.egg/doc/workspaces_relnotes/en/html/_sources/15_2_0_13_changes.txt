What's New in cs.workspaces 15.2.0 SL 13?
#########################################


The module cs.vp.bomcreator was moved into its own package "cs.bomcreator"
==========================================================================
The generic mechanism for generating BOMs was moved to a separate package. The WSM-specific methods, on the other hand,
are still part of cs.workspaces.

For most customers, this should not make a difference. However, there are some things to consider:

* Custom BOM methods must now get assigned to a module. You can accomplish this with drag and drop on the appropriate
  tab of the module ("Additional content").

* If you usually install cs.workspaces separately, you should be aware that there is a new dependency: the package cs.bomcreator.
  If you install the complete "CIM DATABASE Applications" archive, cs.bomcreator is automatically installed.

* There are now two default configurations for BOM generating: "Default" and "Default (WSM)". "Default (WSM)" will
  be applied if cs.workspaces is installed.
  "Default (WSM)" has a priority of 20 and is valid for "default_cad". You should test whether this conflicts with
  a configuration of your own. If necessary, increase the priority of your own configuration.

* If you don't actually use the WSM but do use the generic BOM mechanism, you may consider uninstalling cs.workspaces.
  cs.bomcreator should contain all functionality you need. See the README.rst of cs.bomcreator for instructions.
