Release Notes for 15.2.2
########################

The package is designed to work with |cs.platform| |elements_15_2|.

Elements UI
===========

The application has been adapted to the new design of Elements UI. The standard
configuration allows reading access to all documents.

|cdbpy|
=======

Object Life Cycle Calculation
-----------------------------
The functions `CalculateOLC`, `GetOLCRelevantAttributes` and
`GetReadonlyAttrsIfOLCStarted` has been added with Service Level 7 to
`cs.documents.Document`. You might overwrite this functions if you use a
copy of the standard solution.

Presetting attributes for a new document
----------------------------------------
The function `GetInitialCreateValues` has been added with Service Level 7 to
`cs.documents.Document` to provide attributes that has to be set automatically
when creating a new document.

Access system
=============
The access right ``save`` has been added to the Access Conrol Domain
``cs.documents: Documents (RELEASED)`` in Service Level 7 with the
:guilabel:`exclusive` flag set to prevent that a
released document can be changed by anyone even if the access is granted
elsewhere. If your access system is updated automatically
(see :file:`cdbpkg_sync.conf`) you have to ensure that this change is
appropiate for your installation.
