:guilabel:`Change Status`
=========================
The standard solution of `cs.documents` contains an implementation that allows
you to change the status for several documents in one step.

From a technical point of view the batch operation has 4 parameters

- ``param1``: The integer value of status as stored in ``z_status``.

- ``param2``: The status name

- ``param3``: A flag that determines if documents that are referenced by this
  document should be included to the batch operation. If the flag is set and
  the status of a document changes while executing the batch operation the
  system tries to change the status of the referenced documents in the same way.
  If the status of a document is already the target status the status of referenced
  documents is not changed. The parameter is not visible in the standard mask
  that parametrizes the batch operation. If the status of referenced documents
  depends on the status of the referencing document you should implement
  that dependency in your customizing and the behaviour should not depend on
  the way the user changes a status.

- ``param4``: If the value is ``1`` the document will be unlocked as part of the
  after the status has changed.
