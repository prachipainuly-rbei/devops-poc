Defining the default document class
###################################

.. index::
    single: Property; ddc

The class can be configured using the ``ddc`` (default document class) property.
The class is used if an action is run on documents where the class is not
specified by any context.
Creating a new document by dragging from the |tm.windows| desktop and
dropping into the empty area of the main window in the system client or the
file editing window provides an example of one type of this
context-free action. If the property is not set, the ``document`` class is
used.

This means that setting this property is useful if different instances of
access to document management have been configured for different user groups.
