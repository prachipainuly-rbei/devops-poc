Ident mechanism
###############

A document is uniquely identified in the system using a number and an index.
However, there are situations where the actual document number together
with the version is not unique.
For example, a document could consist of several sheets. In this case,
it is necessary to separate the technical document number
(``zeichnung.z_nummer``) from the document number that appears
in the :guilabel:`Document No.` field. 

.. index::
    single: Property; iden

The ident mechanism provides an option to address this issue.
In order to use the mechanism, the ``iden`` property has to be set to ``true``.
In addition, the class ``document`` has to contain the ``ident`` attribute.
This is then assigned to the document number in the masks.
If the ident mechanism is active, the user identifies a document using the
ident the system used to generate the document number for the entry in
the database instead of the original document number.
The number is generated before calling the standard user exits at the ``pre``
execution time.

.. index::
    single: Property; ipre

.. index::
    single: Property; isuf

The calculated document number consists of a part of the ident and
sequential number. The ``ipre`` property specifies how many digits
of the ident are taken over in the document number.
The ``isuf`` property determines how many digits the sequential number is to
consist of, which are then attached to the number.
