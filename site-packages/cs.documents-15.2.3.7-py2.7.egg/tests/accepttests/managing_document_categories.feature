Feature: Managing Document Categories

In order to keep track of documents inside CIM DATABASE
As a administrator
I want to be able to define and manage categories, which can
subsequently be used by writers to categorize their documents


Scenario: Create New Document Category
    WHEN Administrator creates a new document category
    THEN a new document category is generated


#Scenario: Change Document Category
#    GIVEN a document category exists
#    WHEN Administrator changes this category
#    THEN the changed category is saved


Scenario Outline: Copy Document Category
    GIVEN a document category exists
    WHEN Administrator copies this category
    THEN the category is copied


Scenario: Delete Document Category
    GIVEN a document category exists
    WHEN Administrator deletes this category
    THEN the category is deleted
