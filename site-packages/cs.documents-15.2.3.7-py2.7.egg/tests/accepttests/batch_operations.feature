Feature: Batch Operations

In order to be able to efficiently handle big amount of documents in CIM DATABASE
As a writer
I want to be able to perform operations on document sets in batch 
  
Note: with 'writer' we mean somebody who handles documents in CIM Database.


Background:
    GIVEN a batch operation exists
        AND a document exists

Scenario: Allocate a Document to a Batch Operation
    WHEN writer allocates this document to the batch operation
    THEN the document is allocated to the batch operation


Scenario: Delete allocation of Document to a Batch Operation
    GIVEN the document is allocated to the batch operation
    WHEN writer deletes this document from the batch operation
    THEN the allocation of the document to the batch operation is deleted

        
Scenario: Execute Batch Operation with Assigned Documents
    GIVEN the document is allocated to the batch operation
    WHEN writer executes this batch operation
    THEN the operation is executed on all allocated documents
