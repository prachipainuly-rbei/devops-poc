What's New In |product|?
========================

|product| comes with a lot of updates, some of which will require you to to
review your customizing, and possibly adapt it to these changes.

New Package cscdb.product
=========================

|product| installation needs the new package cscdb.product. If updating |product| 
from an older version (< 11) please manually install this package.
The windows client for |product| is then available via the installation portal 
or in the bin directory of this package.

Share Objects
=============

|product| now supports sharing and discussing business objects based on the
Activity Stream.
For details please see the `Share` chapter in the Activity Stream user manual.
``Share`` replaces the previous feature ``Distribute`` which is now deprecated
and will be completely removed from CONTACT Elements Platform starting with the
next major release. Please migrate your customer specific usages of 
``Distribute`` to ``Share``.


Task E-Mail Notifications
=========================

Previously, each user had an attribute (``angestellter.email_with_task``,
displayed as a checkbox in the user dialog) to determine if that user should
receive an e-mail whenever a new task is ready.

|product| makes this a personal setting, accessible to each user in
:menuselection:`Settings â€“> Personal settings -> Notifications`. Its default
value for new users is 1 ("DO send an e-mail whenever a new task is ready").
Existing users' settings will be migrated automatically.

While the old attribute still exists in |product|, it is now deprecated, and
will be removed in the next major update.

This change will affect how your Administrators set up new users. Copying a
template user will no longer affect this setting. Keep in mind you can use
Common Roles for having different default Personal Settings for new users.


Internationalization
====================

|product| and its application's terminology were comprehensively overhauled.
First and foremost, this fixes and updates a lot of the english terms used
throughout the system, but german terms were also updated in many cases.

We understand this is a severe change to make, thus updating your instance to
the new terminology is optional wherever possible. Nontheless, the following
goals made reworking much of our terminology a necessity:

#. Having consistent terms across all languages. This includes fixing typos as
   well as using a single term to identify a single object system-wide.
#. Using terms which are industry standards or have caught on in the PLM world
   wherever possible over homegrown terms.
#. Being able to add new languages to |product| based off a clean, and sensible
   english template.
#. Using the new "Multi-Language Attributes" consistently and system-wide.

The following is an overview of the updates concerning |product| itself. Many of
these also apply to applications. For details concerning a specific application,
please also see that application's release notes (linked below).


.. _11_0_0-standardization:

Standardization of Terms
------------------------

Terms have been changed to be more concise and consistent in identifying
objects:

* Object status (as in Object Lifecycles) is always ``status`` now. All
  occurrences of other terms (such as ``state``) have been replaced.


.. _11_0_0-catalogs:

Updated Catalogs ("Browsers")
-----------------------------

Catalogs (classes ``cdb_browser`` and ``cdb_browser_cfg``) are updated
throughout the system:

* A new attribute ``obsolete`` is added, which can be used to hide specific
  catalog values.
* A 1:1 relationship is added for each class using the catalog to prevent
  deleting catalog values referenced in object data.
* Catalogs now take advantage of |product|'s new multi-language capabilities. As
  this is done differently, depending on the catalog's old configuration, each
  case is detailed below.

  .. note::
    You will have to change any catalog usage in custom modules accordingly.


.. _11_0_0-catalogs-1-n:

Added Multi-Language Capabilities to Single-Language Catalogs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Catalogs previously only using a single language are updated to use the new
"Multi-Language Attributes" to support multiple languages as follows:

* To prevent the need for migrating your data, keys are kept intact (if not
  explicitely stated otherwise). This means you will still have german key
  values in your database. Key attributes are re-labeled to ``ID``.
* Each catalog gets a new "Multi-Language Attribute" with predefined german and
  english translations. This attribute will be displayed in the UI to show the
  catalog value in the logged in user's chosen language.
* Classes using the catalog get a new Mapped or Joined Multi-Language Attribute which will
  replace the catalog value's (german) ID in the class's UI.

.. _11_0_0-catalogs-n-n:

Updated Multi-Language Capabilities of Catalogs Already Supporting Multiple Languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Catalogs get a new "Multi-Language Attribute" such as ``name``, which wraps
  existing attributes (e.g. ``name_de`` and ``name_en``) as translations. The new
  multi language attribute then replaces the old ones in the catalog's UI.

* Classes using the catalog get a new "Mapped Multi-Language Attribute" titled
  such as ``mapped_<old_attribute>_name``, which is used in that class's UI instead of
  the old attribute.

  .. note::
    Existing "Mapped Attributes" and "Joined Attributes" referencing the catalog
    are removed. Please adapt your customizing accordingly.

.. _11_0_0-olc:

Updated Status Names
--------------------

The primary status names (as written to object's ``cdb_status_txt`` attribute)
have been renamed to improve consistency, and re-translated to english. Also,
status colors have been changed to correspond to the new status names.

Because the language-agnostic ``cdb_status_txt`` attributes are replaced in the
UI only by "Joined Multi-Language Attributes" (named ``joined_status_name``),
but not removed from the class definitions, there is no need to migrate your
data. You can still use the old attributes in custom UI.

  .. note::
    If you decide not to update the status names please check if your 
    object lifecycle images are still consistent with your current status names
    and regenerate the object lifecycle images that are not consistent!

.. _11_0_0-translation:

Translated Configuration Objects
--------------------------------

Textual identificators of configuration objects have been translated to english.
Notable examples are **Predicates** and **Relationship Access Profiles**. Please
check the updates thoroughly for objects you reference by name in your custom
modules.

* Access Control Domains
* Predicates
* Relationship Access Profiles

using the turkish or chinese language, please extend the language lists 
``Activated GUI-Languages`` and ``Application Data Languages`` and the 
system property ``active_languages``.
